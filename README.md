# stock-analysis

##Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to refractor a VBA code used to loop through a dozen stocks in module 2 so it can handle running  a much expansive list of stocks. Specifically, the VBA solution code, used to loop through all 12 stock data in Module 2, was tested again once refracted. Then it was determine whether refactoring the code successfully made the VBA script run faster. When finally ruuning our new VBA script on the same data set for Module 2, pop-ups with script run time for both new and old were used to compare their effeincy. Essentially, the speed of the codes was used to determine if refactoring was successful or not.

## Summary
###Advatages and Disadvantages of Refracting
When refracting a code, the upside can be great if theres a high chance of enhacing the code. For example, condensing codes if the script looks long, has redundancies, or has too many bugs. If it looks wrong and can be enhabced, why not. Most of the time, just having another peer review one's work is refactoring itself. 

The main downside of refactoring is the proccess of refactoring itself! In a perfect world, refactoring codes to inhance the speed, or simply restructuring code without changing its behavior, creates a better code overall. The time consumption in doing so, can be costly in the real word when there's deadlines near. For example, if it takes a longer time to refactor a code rather than starting from scratch, do do it. Another example is if the code itslef is already stable or if you don't have time to test the new code. It all comes down to if it's worth the time or not.
